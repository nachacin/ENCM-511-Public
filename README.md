# ENEL-511-Projects
A repository for version control and collaboration for ENCM 511 projects developed by group 4.  

Check out driver-project-3.X for the latest work. We aimed to optimize the firmware for power efficiency. The MCU uses zero polling; it only checks input pins when a change notification interrupt occurs, avoiding any wasted loop iterations. Adequate software debouncing strategies and state management accomplished this.
