# Embedded-Projects
A repository for version control and collaboration for ENCM 511 projects developed by group 4.

Check out multimeter.X for the latest work. We integrated several modules to implement a multimeter capable of measuring voltage, resistance, capacitance, and frequency. We make use of the PIC24F's ADC, Comparator and Input Capture modules to obtain measurements that are then transmitted through UART in ASCII format. By using a serial terminal, one is able to monitor readings as buttons are pressed to enter each mode.
